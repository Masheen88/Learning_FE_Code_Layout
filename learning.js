//Use Comments to Break down questions

/*
Example of a question:
1. Write a function that adds two numbers together and returns the sum  of the two numbers.

Example of a question broken down manageable steps:
Step 1: Create three variables, num1, num2, and sum.
Step 2: Assign values to num1 and num2.
Step 3: Add num1 and num2 together and assign the result to sum.
Step 4: Print sum in a console.log.

Once you are Done with the steps, fill in the blanks with code accordingly. This may requiring updating or changing the order of the steps.

//Step 1: Create three variables, num1, num2, and sum.
//Step 2: Assign values to num1 and num2.

//Use Comments to document what each piece of your code is DOING
let num1 = 5; //assigns the value of 5 to num1
let num2 = 10; //assigns the value of 10 to num2
let sum = 0; //assigns the value of 0 to sum

//Step 3: Add num1 and num2 together and assign the result to sum.
sum = num1 + num2; //adds num1 and num2 together and assigns the result to sum

//Step 4: Print sum in a console.log.
//Use Console logs to test your code, see what is happening, and describe what is happening
console.log("This is the sum of num1 and num2:", sum); //prints the value of sum to the console
